# rmw_gurumdds
Implementation of the ROS middleware interface using [GurumNetworks GurumDDS](http://www.gurum.cc).

## Requirements
This project requires `rosidl_typesupport_gurumdds` to be built. For more information, see README.md of the [project](https://github.com/ros2/rosidl_typesupport_gurumdds).

Required version of GurumDDS depends on the version of this project.

| rmw_gurumdds            | GurumDDS                    |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1.0.3                   | 2.7.x                       |
| 1.0.2 or lower          | 2.6.x                       |

## Packages
This project consists of four packages, `rmw_gurumdds_cpp`, `rmw_gurumdds_static_cpp`, `rmw_gurumdds_shared_cpp` and `demo_nodes_cpp_native_gurumdds`.

### rmw_gurumdds_cpp
`rmw_gurumdds_cpp` is the rmw implementation. You can use this rmw implementation by setting environment variable `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_gurumdds_cpp` after installation. For `rmw_gurumdds_cpp` to work properly, make sure to set environment variable `GURUMDDS_CONFIG=$GURUMDDS_HOME/gurumdds.yaml` and set `allow_loopback` variable in `gurumdds.yaml` to `true`. If you are not familiar with [YAML](https://yaml.org/), please note that YAML only supports spaces, not tabs, for indentation.  

```
DATA:
  allow_loopback: true
  dynamic_buffer: true
  mtu: auto # auto | number(1472)
  bitmap_capacity: 256
  buffer_capacity: 512
```

### rmw_gurumdds_static_cpp
`rmw_gurumdds_static_cpp` is another rmw implementation, which uses `rosidl_typesupport_gurumdds`, our own typesupport packages. You can use this rmw implementation with environment variable `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_gurumdds_static_cpp`. Other settings and configurations are the same as `rmw_gurumdds_cpp`.  
This package is disabled by default.

### rmw_gurumdds_shared_cpp
`rmw_gurumdds_shared_cpp` contains some functions used by both `rmw_gurumdds_cpp` and `rmw_gurumdds_static_cpp`.

### demo_nodes_cpp_native_gurumdds
`demo_nodes_cpp_natvie_gurumdds` is similar to `demo_nodes_cpp_native` from ROS2 `demos`. This demo shows how to access the native handles of `rmw_gurumdds_cpp`.  
This package is disabled by default.

## Branches
There are four active branches in this project: master, foxy, eloquent and dashing.  
New changes made in [ROS2 repository](https://github.com/ros2) will be applied to the master branch, so this branch might be unstable.
If you want to use this project with ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy, Eloquent Elusor or Dashing Diademata, please use foxy, eloquent or dashing branch, respectively.  

## Implementation Status
Currently some features are not fully implemented.
- DDS Security
